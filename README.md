# PassGen.py
A simple password generator using Python. 

This generator uses tkinter to create a simple window with buttons. The program uses the tkinter command pullback feature to allow password generation with the click of a button. The program also allows the user to select their own password length using a spinbox. Lastly, the program allows the user to copy their password to their clipboard, to use elsewhere. 

This was constructed in 58 minutes using the tkinter docs ( tkdocs.com ) and an outdated partially put together python 2 password gen tutorial...
